Hair falls out in men in general in the front and top of the head, because the hair follicles in those areas are affected by the hormone testosterone, which decreases with age leads to hair loss in it. As for the hair in the back of the head (the donor area of ​​the hair), it is not affected by the hormone testosterone, and for this reason the dense area remains in the hair. The difference in the effect of the hormone varies from one man to another, and this difference is mainly due to genetic factors. In addition to the genetic factor, there are other causes of hair loss in men such as iron deficiency in the blood, lack of activity of the thyroid gland, fungi in the scalp, specific medications and psychological stress states, and other reasons."

Breast augmentation, which is one of the most popular surgeries performed in Turkey with the latest technologies, aims to give women the appearance of the breast they want. FDA Center studies have demonstrated that silicone breast augmentation does not open the way to cancer or any other diseases. Also, there is no longer a need for mammography because it is possible to search for a lesion in women who use a breast gland by means of MR or ultrasound. Breast augmentation surgery is performed by injecting the fat taken from another part of the body into the form of stem cells and injecting it into the breast tissue or transplanting it. This process is also called breast implants. Since the injection method is not applicable to everyone, the method of cultivation is generally preferred. Breast structure is different and unique in every woman. For this reason, the size and structure of the filling that should be grown in women who are considering breast augmentation surgery should be determined according to the woman's expectations and body structure with the examination with the doctor."

Before surgery, you should discuss your choices of size and appearance with your doctor. In light of this information, your doctor will choose the most appropriate filler of various types. The types of breast pads differ in their content, shape and structure. The silicone breast filling is divided into two types (anatomical filling and a circular filling) and the anatomical filling is considered the closest to the natural shape of the breast. The breast filling is divided into two types. In terms of content, there is a type that contains saline and a type that contains silicone. As for the surface, there is a smooth type and a composite type. Your doctor will listen to your expectations, and based on the ratio of height, weight, rib width and shoulder, the surgery will start after you choose the filling that best suits you. If your breasts are flabby, your doctor may also recommend a breast lift. In addition, your doctor will ask you to do some tests before surgery to determine if there is any obstacle to the operation. There are some points that must be taken into consideration before surgery: Inform the doctor about the medicines that you use, you should refrain from food and drink 5-6 hours before the operation, a week before the operation should stop taking headache medications, herbal tonics, vitamins and aspirin.
